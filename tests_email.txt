Salut Anurag,
 
Uwe has come up with a nice checklist that we recommend to go through in order to detect errors or implementation bugs (see below). I suggest you run the checks and then produce the plots mentioned below in the "analysis section". Let me know if you manage to produce them until Thu afternoon so I could possibly include them into my ETH presentation (purely voluntarily if you are interested to be quoted with your study).
 
Other than that I have a short list of additional tests you could run which I'd like to send you once you have successfully completed the tests.
 
Best regards & speak soon,
Joerg & Uwe
 
 
Assuming a Black-Scholes model.
 
Test01:
-          Verify that the mean of the final spot price is equal to the forward (X)
-          Verify that the variance of log spot final is equal to volatility squared x time to maturity (X)
-          Visually inspect 20 spot price paths (X)
-          Verify that all spot prices are non-negative (X)


Test02:
-          Verify that the simulated option value is equal to the value of the same option using the Black-Scholes formula, for both call and put.
-          Verify that the simulated option delta is equal to the delta of the same option using the Black-Scholes formula, for both call and put.
-          Verify that the simulated option value for path-independent options (such as call and put) are independent of the discretization over time (pending)


Test03:
-          For barrier and touch options with path-dependent barriers ensure that continuity correction is in place (pending)
-          For barrier options take the example of a down-and-out call with the barrier below strike and an up and out call with the barrier above strike (not done)
-          Verify that for barrier options value and delta are equal to the Black-Scholes closed form solution.
-          Verify with graphical visualization that the value of the barrier option converges monotone to the value of the corresponding vanilla option as the barrier moves far away
-          Verify that the variance of the hedge error decreases as the time steps increase
-          Test the impact of the hedge error by increasing the volatility (e.g. linearly) over the time to maturity.

Use some different market data and contract data assumptions for all of the above including a low vol (5%) and a high vol (50%) scenario. Document all test results in a log file.
 
After the Monte Carlo simulation hedge engine has passed all the tests, the actual analysis can be performed, which includes:
 
Impact of the time to re-hedge (Q:for barrier options as well?)
Impact of bid offer spreads in spot trading (Q: code change needed. OK?)
Impact of constraints such as min/max amounts at a time or per day, bounds on delta/gamma/leverage, no shortselling. (OK)
All impacts should show at least the mean and variance of the hedge error (simulated portfolio value minus Black-Scholes value), possibly also higher moments skew and kurtosis.(OK)
Impact of stochastic volatility
 
On the simulation tool on the web: label axes so one can see which graph shows which result.
